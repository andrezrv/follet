<h1 id="follet-development-principles">Follet Development Principles</h1>
<p>Just as WordPress, Follet is opinionated software. This means that it presents a clear statement about how things are expected to be done. The presence of every feature (and sometimes even its absence) relies (or at least it should) on a conscious decision, made to provide both a great experience for the user, and code that is easy to understand and extend for the developer. These are the principles that rule the development process of Follet:</p>
<ul>
<li>Themes should be fully translatable.</li>
<li>Themes should support child themes.</li>
<li>Themes should be easy to understand and customize, both for end users and developers.</li>
<li>Classes should be used when class properties are required, not as simple containers for functions.</li>
<li>Preferentially, class methods should not be applied directly in template files. Non-programmer developers are more familiar to functions than they are to object-related notions.</li>
<li>Themes should not add new <a href="https://codex.wordpress.org/Global_Variables">global variables</a>. If a container for information and functionality is needed, use a <a href="http://code.tutsplus.com/articles/design-patterns-in-wordpress-the-singleton-pattern--wp-31621">singleton</a> instead.</li>
<li>Functional-only features are <a href="https://make.wordpress.org/themes/guidelines/guidelines-plugin-territory/">plugin territory</a> and should be avoided as much as possible.</li>
<li>Mixed functional and presentational features may be supported, but not enabled by default, since they might lead to conflicts when switching to other theme.</li>
<li>Themes should provide few but powerful and understandable customization options. Any supported option or feature that might break the simplicity of a theme should be preferentially disabled by default.</li>
<li>All the customizations that can be performed via the admin area should be preferentially managed through the <a href="https://codex.wordpress.org/Theme_Customization_API">theme customizer</a>, since that way changes can be seen and tested live before being applied, relying in WordPress built-in functionality. Theme options are discouraged, for they can lead to broken output that cannot be easily detected before being applied.</li>
<li>Themes should provide understandable, extendable and mantainable code. This can be achieved, among other practices, by following the <a href="http://codex.wordpress.org/WordPress_Coding_Standards">WordPress Coding Standards</a>, using all built-in functionality as possible, and offering <a href="http://codex.wordpress.org/Pluggable_Functions">pluggable functions</a> and <a href="http://codex.wordpress.org/Plugin_API/Hooks">filter hooks</a> for all the template tags called within the template files.</li>
<li>PHP, JS and CSS code should be split in different files to allow other developers to deal with different design and functionality elements separatedly, as modularly as possible.</li>
<li>When possible, themes should offer design elements that are visually compatible with major plugins.</li>
<li>When creating content, what is seen in the editor should be as similar as possible to what is seen in the front-end.</li>
</ul>
