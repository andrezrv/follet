Follet
======

Named after [Ken Follet](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ken_Follett), author of [The Pillars of the Earth](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Pillars_of_the_Earth), a wonderful novel about building amazing things, Follet is a fully responsive, customizable, translation-ready and extendable theme for WordPress. SEO friendly via HTML5 standards and [schema.org](http://schema.org) microdata, compatible with all post formats, and customizable via [WordPress Customizer](https://codex.wordpress.org/Theme_Customization_API). It also features primary and secondary optional colors, intelligent widget areas, which won't show when no widgets are attached to them, and a lot of easy-to-use options under the hood to activate and extend. Clean and lean PHP, HTML, CSS and JS code, written by [WordPress Coding Standards](http://codex.wordpress.org/WordPress_Coding_Standards). Works impressively well right out of the box, and can be used either as a main theme, a parent theme for your own child theme, or as a starter theme to create your own version.
