Follet

A fully responsive, customizable, translation-ready and extendable theme. SEO friendly via schema.org microdata, and compatible with all post formats. It features intelligent widget areas, which won't show if no widgets are attached to them. Customizable via WordPress Customizer and a lot of easy-to-use options under the hood. Clean and lean PHP, HTML, CSS and JS code, written by WordPress Coding Standards. Works impressively well right out of the box, and can be used either as a main theme, a parent theme for your own child theme, or as a starter theme to create your own version.

Docs are coming soon :)
